        <h1>EDEM "THE MAGNIFICENT"</h1>
        <p>Edem Francois was born in Ghana, West Africa. Really beautiful place and this is why Edem has a very wonderful
            personality. Eventhough he was born and raised in Ghana, Edem is very open to expanding his horizon. After
            highschool, he moved to Canada to do his undergrad. Canada plays a very vital role in Edem's life. This is where 
            he got his first job, met his first girlfriend, he joined the Army and so on. After 10 years
            in Canada, Edem had enough of Canada so moved to Madrid to pursue bigger dreams.</p>
        
        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Edem was born in Accra, the Capital of Ghana to really awesome parents.

            <br>He has 3 siblings and is the eldest of them. His main hobby was Basketball. He dreamt of becoming a basketball
            player, but God had bigger plans for him. (The story is still being told).</p> 

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Edem had all his elementary and highschool education in Ghana. In 2009, he moved to Canada to do his undergrad in 
            Business Administration and graduated in 2015. He should have majored in Computer Science. The real world thought him 
            that there are no interesting opportunities in the Business field. Everything was moving to Technology 
            and this was very intriguing to him.</p>

        <p>In September 2018, he enrolled in a Computer Science Master at IE University in Madrid. This will serve as a very 
            defining moment in Edem's life and for his career. Edem met wonderful colleagues and made important connections such 
            as Pepe Garcia. In July 2019, Edem graduated from IE and landed a job with Microsoft. </p>

        <h2>Professional Career</h2>
        <p>Edem's first real job after University was in Banking. In 2016, he started with CIBC bank. This bank job showed him
            exactly what he should not pursue in life; which is a career in Finance.</p>

        <p>Edem also enlisted in the Canadian Armed Forces in 2017 as Signals Officer.</p>
